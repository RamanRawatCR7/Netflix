<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[**Netflix**](https://netflix-clone-899b8.web.app/)

1. It is a clone of Netflix.  I'm using API from https://www.themoviedb.org/ to get the data of Movies, TV Series and such which are currently on Netflix.
2. The first page of the site is the home page where it says "get started".
3. Upon clicking it, it'll take you to the sign in page.
4. If you already have an account click "Sign In" else click "Sign up now" after filling in the email address and password.
5. After signing in/signing up it takes you to the main page where I use that data to put them in 8 rows category wise and clicking those posters of movies will show you the trailer of that movie.
6. Clicking on the Avatar icon at the top right will take you to the profile screen where you can see your email id along with subscription plan and the renewal date.
7. Upon clicking on the plan buttons it'll take you to the Stripe payment gateway where you can enter your details(test details) and purchase the plan, after purchasing the plan it'll redirecting you back to the profile screen where you can see the changes in the plan you purchased.
8. If you close the site without signing out and reopen it, it'll have your account opened without needing to sign in again.

Its a single page website right now but i'm stilling working on it to make it a full-fledged Netflix.
